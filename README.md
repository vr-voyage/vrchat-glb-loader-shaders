# About

This repository contains the shaders used by my
[https://github.com/vr-voyage/vrchat-glb-loader](VRChat 3D Model Loader), and its
utilities.

Since the utilities can be installed and used in a project separated
from the VRChat World Gimmick, the shaders were also separated from
the main package.

These shaders are just modified versions of :
* [MToon 1.x](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/tree/master/Packages/VRM10/MToon10)
* [ShaderMotion](https://github.com/CuteWaterBeary/ShaderMotion)

Their namespaces and names were slightly changed to avoid conflicting
with the official versions of this shader when present in the same
Unity project.
