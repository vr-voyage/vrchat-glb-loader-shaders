# About

This repository contains the shaders used by my
[https://github.com/vr-voyage/vrchat-glb-loader](VRChat 3D Model Loader), and its
utilities.

Since the utilities can be installed on separate project,
the shaders are separated from the main package.

These shaders are just modified versions of :
* [MToon 1.x](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/tree/master/Packages/VRM10/MToon10)
* [ShaderMotion](https://github.com/CuteWaterBeary/ShaderMotion)

Their namespaces and names were slightly change to avoid conflicting
with the official versions of this shader when present in the same
Unity project.
